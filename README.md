# dicepass
Easy python script for generating dice passphrases. In work at the moment.

It was written just to feed my paranoia and to practice in Python scripting :)

You should use [passphraseme](https://github.com/micahflee/passphraseme) by @micahflee or any other similar tool for everyday basis.
